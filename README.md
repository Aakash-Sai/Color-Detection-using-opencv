* For this program to run, python must be installed on your computer along with the Pandas and Opencv libraries. You can download python from their original website. For downloading the libraries simply type the following commands in the command prompt to install each one of them.
> python -m pip install pandas

> python -m pip install opencv-python

* Then you can run the code. The program will open a window with a picture. Now all you have to do is click anywhere on the picture and the color of the clicked area will be displayed.
* To exit press ‘esc’ key on your laptop.
